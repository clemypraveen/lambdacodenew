Key Responsibilities:

Infrastructure Automation: Design, build, and maintain scalable and resilient infrastructure on AWS using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools such as AWS CloudFormation or Terraform. Implement and manage AWS services, including EC2 instances, VPCs, load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and database systems.

Continuous Integration and Deployment: Implement and maintain continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, and Jenkins. Automate the build, test, and deployment processes to enable frequent and reliable software releases.

Configuration Management: Develop and manage configuration management solutions using tools like AWS Systems Manager, Ansible, or Chef. Automate the configuration and management of software and infrastructure components to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring and alerting solutions using tools like AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana. Monitor application and infrastructure metrics, set up alarms, and establish proactive response mechanisms to ensure high availability and performance.

Security and Compliance: Implement and maintain security best practices and compliance requirements in the AWS environment. Ensure proper access controls, encryption, and secure network configurations. Collaborate with the security team to conduct security assessments and remediate vulnerabilities.

Performance Optimization: Identify performance bottlenecks in the infrastructure and application stack. Analyze and optimize system performance, including database queries, network configurations, and resource allocation, to achieve optimal efficiency and scalability.

Incident Response and Troubleshooting: Collaborate with development and operations teams to investigate and resolve production incidents. Implement effective logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify and respond to issues. Conduct root cause analysis and implement preventative measures.

Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Create and maintain documentation related to infrastructure, deployment processes, and troubleshooting guides. Share knowledge and best practices with the team and conduct training sessions to improve overall DevOps capabilities.

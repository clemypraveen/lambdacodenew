Cloud infrastructure deployment without Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be challenging and prone to various difficulties. Here are some challenges you may face when deploying cloud infrastructure without IaC:

Manual Configuration: Deploying cloud infrastructure without IaC often involves manual configuration of resources, such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and security settings. This manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to reproduce consistently.

Lack of Version Control: Without IaC, it becomes challenging to track and manage changes to your infrastructure over time. Version control systems, like Git, provide the ability to track changes, collaborate, and roll back to previous configurations. Without version control, it becomes challenging to maintain an accurate and auditable history of your infrastructure changes.

Limited Reusability: Manual configuration of infrastructure tends to lack reusability. Each deployment requires repetitive manual steps, which increases the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies. It becomes difficult to standardize configurations across different environments, leading to configuration drift and difficulties in maintaining consistent infrastructure.

Scalability and Efficiency: Scaling your infrastructure manually can be complex and time-consuming. Without IaC, it becomes challenging to provision and deprovision resources dynamically to meet changing demands. Scaling your infrastructure efficiently becomes more difficult, resulting in potential resource underutilization or overprovisioning.

Configuration Drift: Configuration drift occurs when the actual state of the infrastructure deviates from the intended state. Without IaC to enforce desired configurations, manual changes and ad hoc modifications can lead to configuration drift over time. This can introduce inconsistencies, security vulnerabilities, and difficulties in managing and troubleshooting the infrastructure.

Lack of Automation: IaC enables automation by scripting and codifying infrastructure configurations. Without IaC, automation becomes limited, and manual intervention is often required for tasks like infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and configuration updates. This increases the risk of human errors, lengthens deployment times, and hampers agility.

Difficulties in Collaboration: Collaborating on infrastructure deployments without IaC can be challenging. It becomes difficult to share and review infrastructure configurations, leading to communication gaps and inconsistencies among team members. This can hinder collaboration and make it harder to maintain a unified infrastructure across a team or organization.

While deploying cloud infrastructure without IaC is possible, it often introduces complexities and risks that can impact efficiency, reliability, and scalability. Adopting IaC practices and leveraging automation through tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible can help address these challenges, streamline deployments, and improve infrastructure management.
